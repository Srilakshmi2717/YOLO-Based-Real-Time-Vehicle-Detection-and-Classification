# YOLO-Based-Real-Time-Vehicle-Detection-and-Classification
This project uses YOLOv8 for real-time detection and classification of 21 vehicle types in traffic images. Fine-tuned on a custom dataset, it supports real-time monitoring via an IP webcam app and multi-camera setup, ideal for traffic surveillance and smart city applications.

In this project, a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model was employed for vehicle detection, leveraging the power of deep learning and computer vision to identify various types of vehicles in traffic images. The dataset comprised 2704 training images and corresponding labels, containing annotations for 21 vehicle classes including cars, buses, motorcycles, and ambulances. The YOLOv8 model, pre-trained on the COCO dataset, was fine-tuned on the custom dataset. This involved specifying a custom YAML configuration file, which defined the dataset paths and vehicle classes. The training process spanned 10 epochs, with metrics such as box loss, class loss, and distance focal loss (DFL) monitored to gauge the model's performance. Training and validation precision, recall, mean average precision (mAP), and other key metrics were tracked and visualized using seaborn and matplotlib to ensure an in-depth analysis of the model's learning curve. To evaluate the model, the trained YOLO model was used to predict and visualize detections on a set of validation images, with bounding boxes accurately highlighting the detected vehicles. A significant aspect of this project was the incorporation of real-time vehicle detection using an IP webcam app and a multi-camera setup. This real-time detection system allowed for live monitoring and analysis of traffic from multiple viewpoints, demonstrating the practical application of the model in dynamic, real-world environments. The real-time setup was achieved by streaming video feeds from multiple cameras, processed by the trained YOLO model to detect and annotate vehicles in real-time. This comprehensive approach to vehicle detection using the YOLO model underscores its robustness and adaptability for real-world traffic surveillance and analysis applications, highlighting its potential for enhancing traffic management systems and contributing to smart city infrastructure.
